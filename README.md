# lister-AI
an AI for putting words in categories

I made listerai.txt for data learning, and the structure has to be like this if you want to add something:

word,category,category,category

you can add as much categories as you want

listerat.txt is small not that big so NOW the accuracy is 0.01266624445851805 that not good so don't be suprised if the AI is bad
